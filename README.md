## How to use

```
netlify dev
```

## What's the purpose ?

This project is mostly a helper project (but mostly the code behing
[spotify.maferland.com](https://spotify.maferland.com)) for
[@maferand/spotify-react](https://www.github.com/maferland/spotify-react).

This project store authorization codes to make your spotify most recently
listened tracks publicly available. If you want to authorize please go
[here](https://spotify.maferland.com).

Then, you should be able to get your history like this (that's me!):

```
curl spotify.maferland.com/.netlify/functions/recently-played/12166023407
```
